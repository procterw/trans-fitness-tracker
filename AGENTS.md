When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

Read PROJECT.md for top level project details and goals. 

If sample input is needed for testing, use `/Users/williamleahy/Downloads/OIP-710878801.jpg` which is a picture of avcado toast.
